A deep learning-based tool to automatically replace parts of artworks with plausible reconstructions.

Before using DeepCreamPy, the user must mark regions in the artwork using green color with an image editing program (e.g., GIMP, Photoshop). DeepCreamPy takes the images with green colored regions as input, and a neural network automatically fills in the highlighted regions.

You can download the latest release for Windows 64-bit [here](https://github.com/Deepshift/DeepCreamPy/releases/latest).

For users interested in compiling DeepCreamPy themselves, DeepCreamPy can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Features
- Reconstructing images of any size
- Reconstruction of ANY shaped censor (e.g. black lines, pink hearts, etc.)
- Decensoring of mosaic censors
- Limited support for black-and-white/monochrome images
- Generate multiple variations of reconstructions from the same image

## Limitations
The reconstruction is mainly for anime-style human figures that have minor to moderate redactions. If an organ (e.g. arms, legs) is completely deleted, reconstruction will fail.

It does NOT work with:
- Screentones (e.g. printed material)
- Real life material
- Reconstruction of nipples
- Reconstruction of the lower orifice of the alimentary canal
- Animated gifs and videos
